Worth. Now have 5 years experience as a developer (not games) and look back in horror, as I was essentially working as a ""normal developer"" (rather than apprentice as I already did programming for 2 years (A levels) before then and went through all the Unity tutorials in my own time, and I was the only programmer working on game, mentored by technical director who didn't even turn up half the time (he was learning NodeJS and buggered off getting £500 a day, so that company folded).
Only did apprenticeship as it seemed to be the easiest way to get a programmer job without a degree.
Worked there for 5 months and then continued a job somewhere else  for 3 years, apprentice wage for 6 months, min wage for a year then £17k after that (not games, apologies for going off topic but basically apprenticeships in my experience exploit new developers).
