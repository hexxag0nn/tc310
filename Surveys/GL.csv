, Design team lunch (paid for) every 2 months, Employer contribution, equal to 3% of your salary, paid to KiwiSaver (like a government pension) - this is a standard NZ thing.","Salary is low if you take into account for the standard of living in Wellington, it's quite expensive. You won't be able to save much at the end of the month. It could have been compensated with some more considerable benefits like once a year free tickets to home country or something else. Like the salary for a UX Designer at the same position in a product based company(anything other than video game industry) is easily around 75,000-90,000 NZD.
